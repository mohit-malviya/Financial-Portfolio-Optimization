# Financial Portfolio Optimization

## Project Overview
This project is based on Financial Portfolio Optimization, where we analyze the returns and risks of a given set of assets to determine the optimal portfolio allocation. Using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Markowitz Optimization, the goal is to maximize the expected return while minimizing the associated risk of the portfolio.

## Features
- Portfolio expected return calculation
- Portfolio risk (variance) calculation
- Efficient frontier plotting
- Optimal asset allocation using Markowitz mean-variance optimization
- Interactive visualization of portfolio performance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (for optimization)
